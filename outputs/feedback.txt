**Skills Relevance (25 points)**  
Score: 22/25  
The resume demonstrates a strong alignment with relevant skills in computer science and software development. Jake lists a variety of programming languages such as Java, Python, and SQL, which are crucial for technical positions.  

He also includes frameworks and tools like Flask, React, and Docker that are widely used in the industry. However, the inclusion of soft skills like teamwork or communication could enhance this score, as it currently focuses mainly on technical abilities.

**Experience Quality & Quantification (20 points)**  
Score: 17/20  
Jake has solid experience detailed within the resume that showcases both his technical skills and practical deployment of those skills. Significant accomplishments are quantified, such as "contributed 50K+ lines of code," which adds clarity to his contributions.  

Nonetheless, some roles could benefit from more specific metrics regarding his impact or improvements as a result of his contributions, particularly in the IT support role. Quantifying the number of problems solved or user satisfaction rates could strengthen this section.

**Projects & Practical Work (15 points)**  
Score: 14/15  
The projects section is impressive, with Jake showcasing practical applications of his skills, notably through developing a full-stack application with Gitlytics. He not only mentions the technologies used but also describes the application's functions and user interactions, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the development process.  

The one point deducted is for the lack of collaboration or feedback received from users post-launch, which could provide insight into the project's reception and areas for improvement.

**Education Background (10 points)**  
Score: 9/10  
Jake has a relevant educational background with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and an Associate's degree in Liberal Arts. Both degrees help establish a solid foundation for his technical skills.  

However, the addition of any relevant coursework or honors received would add depth to this section. Including notable academic projects would also show practical application during his education.

**Formatting & ATS-Friendliness (10 points)**  
Score: 8/10  
The resume is formatted neatly and is easy to read, with clear sections that can easily be parsed by ATS software. The use of bullet points helps in presenting information succinctly.  

For improvement, a bit more standardization in the layout would help. For instance, consistent use of bolding and italics is important, and clearer section headers could improve visibility. Adding a professional summary at the top could also enhance the ATS performance.

**Technical Depth & Progression (10 points)**  
Score: 9/10  
Jake's resume illustrates a clear progression in his technical skills and responsibilities from roles in undergraduate research to IT support and assistantship positions. Each role builds upon his previous experiences, showcasing an upward trajectory in expertise and responsibility.  

One area for enhancement might be to include specific technologies or methodologies learned in each role to further illustrate how his skillset has evolved over time.

**Soft Skills / Communication (5 points)**  
Score: 3/5  
While the resume primarily emphasizes technical skills, it does not provide much insight into Jake's soft skills or communication abilities. The ability to communicate effectively is critical in collaborative technical environments.  

Although some hints at teamwork lie within his project descriptions, clearer statements about how he collaborated with others or resolved conflicts could strengthen this aspect of his profile.

**Final Summary**:  
Jakeâ€™s resume showcases impressive technical expertise with relevant skills in programming, frameworks, and experience in research and development. The projects and practical work demonstrate his ability to apply his skills effectively in real-world scenarios, which is a notable strength.

However, there are several areas for improvement: adding quantifiable metrics in experience sections could strengthen his impact, and emphasizing soft skills and communication abilities may provide a more holistic view of his candidacy. Lastly, enhancing the resume format slightly for better ATS compatibility will improve his chances of getting noticed. Utilizing a professional summary could also set the tone for the rest of the document, ensuring hiring managers immediately grasp his qualifications.
