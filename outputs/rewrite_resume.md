## Experience

**AI Agent Engineering Intern**  
*Hypermindz.ai* — Remote, USA  
May 2025 – Present  
- Deploy CrewAI-based agents for automated resume evaluation and outreach using Python and ReactJS, demonstrating full-stack software development capabilities  
- Leverage Streamlit to present live agent demos during internal review sessions, facilitating collaborative feedback and iterative improvements  
- Conduct hands-on output reviews to refine prompt design and mitigate agent hallucinations, emphasizing attention to detail and continuous enhancement  

**AI Research Intern**  
*MITRE Corporation* — McLean, VA  
June 2023 – August 2023  
- Explored training generative models (GAN, VAE) on 40K+ instances of network traffic data to simulate realistic user behavior in cyber-attack scenarios, showcasing strong data-driven modeling skills  
- Modeled user decision-making as discrete-time Markov chains and evaluated SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize policy structures  
- Prototyped probabilistic behavior models in Julia using Gen to represent normal users in adversarial network simulations, applying advanced algorithmic techniques  

**Cyber Analytics Intern**  
*MITRE Corporation* — McLean, VA  
June 2022 – August 2022  
- Benchmarked heuristic optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, hill climbing) in high-dimensional cyber simulations, analyzing scalability and runtime performance  
- Implemented simulated annealing from Bertsimas & Tsitsiklis (1993) to optimize multi-objective defense strategies, improving solution performance by ~60%  
- Developed Python tools to detect novel cyber kill chains in red team simulations and support threat modeling, demonstrating practical software engineering and problem-solving
