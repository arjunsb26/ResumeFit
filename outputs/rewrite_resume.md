**AI Research Intern**  
*MITRE Corporation* — McLean, VA  
June 2023 – August 2023  
- Trained generative models (GAN, VAE) on 40K+ network traffic instances to simulate realistic user behavior in cyber-attack scenarios, applying machine learning and data analysis expertise  
- Modeled user decision-making as discrete-time Markov chains and evaluated SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm to refine decision policies, demonstrating algorithmic and statistical modeling skills  
- Prototyped probabilistic behavior models in Julia using Gen to simulate normal user behavior in adversarial network environments  

**Cyber Analytics Intern**  
*MITRE Corporation* — McLean, VA  
June 2022 – August 2022  
- Benchmarked heuristic optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, hill climbing) in high-dimensional cyber simulations, analyzing scalability and runtime performance
